     * chosen bits. If it were a perfect source of randomly chosen bits, then the
     * algorithm shown would choose {@code int} values from the stated range with
     * perfect uniformity.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The algorithm is slightly tricky. It rejects values that would result in an
     * uneven distribution (due to the fact that 2^31 is not divisible by n). The
     * probability of a value being rejected depends on n. The worst case is
     * n=2^30+1, for which the probability of a reject is 1/2, and the expected
     * number of iterations before the loop terminates is 2.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The algorithm treats the case where n is a power of two specially: it returns
     * the correct number of high-order bits from the underlying pseudo-random
     * number generator. In the absence of special treatment, the correct number of
     * &lt;i&gt;low-order&lt;/i&gt; bits would be returned. Linear congruential pseudo-random
     * number generators such as the one implemented by this class are known to have
     * short periods in the sequence of values of their low-order bits. Thus, this
     * special case greatly increases the length of the sequence of values returned
     * by successive calls to this method if n is a small power of two.
